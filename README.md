# Modular design method

Having an underlying design foundation allows everyone to better organize what they're already doing and essentially speak the same language throughout the design workflow. A modular template consists of the following:

**Content**
Text pieces and images

**Components**
Reusable, standalone elements like buttons and titles, the building blocks of your content which should work by themselves in a range of contexts

**Regions**
Groups of content content pieces and components, arranged in a specific way that can't be moved around

**Sections**
Stackable containers of regions between the header and footer to create an overall layout

## Making HTML templates editable

The Blocks Edit CMS framework is a simple library of tags of classes or styles, and attributes that you add to your HTML code to define editable features. It follows the modular design method and compliments standard design systems. [More info â†’](https://blocksedit.com/developer/)
